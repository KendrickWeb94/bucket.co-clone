We’re on a mission to help product
teams to make features customers love
Feature as a first-class citizen
Product teams can find themselves turning into feature factories. They build and
deploy features without knowing if and how they’re being used in the real world.
Bucket’s goal is to change that. With automated feature analytics workflows, Bucket
helps product teams make feature decisions that create impact and delight
customers.

Meet the team behind Bucket. We’re a group of experienced people who care deeply
about making innovative software. Bucket is highly international with our distributed
team based out of the UK, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Portugal, and the
Netherlands.
