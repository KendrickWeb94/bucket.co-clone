Insights that drive adoption
Work with features, not raw events
Raw event counts don't tell the full story, plus they’re a pain to work with. Create
feature objects on Bucket based on usage patterns and grouped events.

Create segments based on STARS feature
usage. Who are your power users who have
adopted most key features and who's only
using a small part of your product?
Export your data for
custom analysis
Automatically export every company’s
complete feature usage into your data
warehouse. Combine Bucket data with your
internal business metrics to tie features to
business outcomes.

performance

across diverse dimensions and timelines with
the Audit Matrix.

that make retrospectives more powerful and
let roadmaps focus on the features
customers crave.
