and automated evaluation is a boon for
modern product teams.”

“Bucket enables our product
teams to increase customer
satisfaction and retention by
acting faster on low feature
engagement and customer
dissatisfaction.”
“Would recommend all product
teams working in SaaS to use
@bucketdotco to measure and
iterate on their feature
development!”
“I can hire a new PM and just
require that they track features
with Bucket because I know
they’ll understand it instantly.”
