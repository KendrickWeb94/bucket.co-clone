Track multiple events in a feature
Previously, each feature on Bucket was tied to a single event, limiting its adaptability. We’ve

Feature and attribute columns in segments
Segments allow you to group companies by login activity and custom attributes. This is useful
for making a segment of monthly active companies or paying customers, for example. However,
when browsing a segment, it isn’t possible to add columns that also show feature engagement
or satisfaction. Until now!

Surfacing churned companies better
Bucket is built on the STARS framework and gives you a STARS funnel out of the box, for any
feature. Provided with a single event, the STARS funnel shows you how far your customers have
reached in the “feature success funnel” for a feature.
